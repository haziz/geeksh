* TODO


. Job control, IPC, I/O redirect and co-processes.

. C-like scripting language based on tcc -run.

. Make the readline(3) setting editable at run time. Also a custom completer
  should be added in order to be able to complete executable files (and
  builtins); the wordexp(3) (or pcre) completion is also possible this way.

. Replace wildcards with Perl-extended regular expressions?

. Functions and aliases: the latter should be a synonym for the former, just
  with a different declaration statement and rules. This way it's possible (and
  easy) to handle arguments in aliases.

. Handle hypen character before the program name (login shell).

. Startup file.

. Scripting language.

. Builtin commands

   - printf	A wrapper for the printf(3) function
   - tzset	Do we really need it?
   - read	Read a value and store it into a variable 
   - What else?

. Allow a meta-directory for the cd bultin command which allows to go up as
  many directory as the number of dots specified.

. Look for all TODOs and XXXs comments into the code.
